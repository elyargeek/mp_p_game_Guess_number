- Description : In fact, this is a small project for practice and learning - This project is a kind of number guessing game which was inspired by Jonas -It was interesting for me, I hope it will be interesting for you too .
- I should also say that I did all the parts of this project myself and made some changes in it .
- Let's go to the game : In this game you have to find a number - This number is hidden between 1 and 20 - You can get help with the guidance button at the bottom of the page - Actually, this button determines whether the hidden number is even or odd, but three points will be deducted from you - Also, you will lose one point with each guess and finally your record will be recorded .
